                <p>*Practice a few tricks in front of the mirror until they become automatic and you are able to perform
                    them without thinking. Then you can give your mind to the presentation. If you really practise, this
                    will set you apart from a good 60% of magicians and that is a conservative estimate. Most magicians
                    want to buy a trick today and perform it tomorrow. <br>
                    *Train with other magicians :Join a magic club
                    *Keep an eye on online forums <br>
                    *Try new tricks, adapt existing tricks and create your own <br>
                    *The difference between an all-right magician and a great magician is often not much more than
                    presentation. Give your routines a story, think what is going to hook and engage the audience. “Look
                    at this!” is usually not enough. Why should the audience be interested? What draws them in?</p>

                <p> *Increase your knowledge of the magic art by reading books and watching magic videos. <br>
                    *Listen to lectures from an experienced magician whenever you can. <br>
                    *Participate in magic lessons given by a professional magician. <br>
                    *If you are lucky enough to live near a magic shop, spend as much time there as you can spare. The
                    dealer will keep you up to date with what’s going on in magic and you may meet some interesting
                    fellow customers. Most dealers are happy to help and encourage new magicians and to show you tricks
                    they think you might like and be able to perform well.</p>
